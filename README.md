## Features

- **Popular Stocks Dashboard(Home)**: In this section you can check top 6 tech companies stock prices for present day.
- **Daily Return Analysis**: For the stock selected from the dropdown below, users will be presented with a summary of the stock return, a price chart, the daily percentage price change over time (highlighting volatility clusters), a histogram of daily percent return, a QQ plot, and a KS statistics test. This test assesses whether the daily percentage price changes conform to a Normal Gaussian Distribution.
- **Stock Return Comparison**: For the four stocks selected from the dropdown below, users can compare metrics including: daily return distribution, 60-day rolling volatility, 60-day rolling Sharpe ratio, 60-day Sortino volatility, and 60-day rolling Sortino ratio.
- **Portfolio Optimiser**: Select a minimum of 5 stocks from the dropdown list below. This application will extract stock returns, including dividends, from January 2020 and construct portfolios with the following characteristics:
- **Cluster Analysis**: In this tab, users can perform cluster analysis on the financial data of stocks within the Dow 30 index. They can select the input features for the analysis and visualize the resulting clusters in a 3D graph.
- **Backtest Trading Strategy**: Backtesting allows traders to simulate a trading strategy using historical data, generating results and analyzing risk before committing any actual capital. The underlying theory is that a strategy that worked well in the past is likely to succeed in the future. Conversely, a strategy that performed poorly in the past is likely to do so in the future.
- **ML Predictions**: From the dropdown menu below, users can select various ML models, stocks, input features, and model parameters to predict the magnitude or direction of stock price changes for the next day.
